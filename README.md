# ReLU vs. GeLU

There's definitely a pretty significant difference between the two (in the case of my example in `main.py`).

GeLU seems to out-perform ReLU.

### Example Output

An example output from running `main.py`

```
Test Loss (GeLU): 0.08334237337112427
Test Loss (ReLU): 0.45898932218551636
